Standard library definitions:
golang.org/pkg

Static Type lang: just like Java, C++, Golang
(whenever we assign a variable we define a type whether the variable is string or integer)

Dynamic type lang: Javascript, Ruby, python
(the interpreter does not care about if we assign a variable to integer, then later on assign it to a String)

Go testing is not RSpec, mocha, jasmine, selenium. (so suffosticated)

deck_test.go (go testing)

go build
go run
go test
